This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).

## Configuration

Authenticate private package `@vorwerk/fibre-react` following the instruction:

- [TEST env](https://dev.azure.com/Vorwerk-FibreSingleBlend/Storybook/_artifacts/feed/Vorwerk-FibreSingleBlend-TESTING/connect). 

It is also possible to use `.npmrc.template` file. This file content must be copied to new file called `.npmrc` in this same directory and missing values must be provided.

npm run dev
```
